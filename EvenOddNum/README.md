 Proiblem: Write a program that reads a set of integers and then finds and prints the sum of the even and odd integers. Assume that the input comes from the keyboard (interactive) and the output goes to the monitor.
 
 Analysis: Given the number of interes to sum, separately calculate the sum of all even and odd intergers in that series.
    even numbers are divisible by 2
 
 Input:
    numInt: The number of intergers to sum
 
 Output:
    evSum: Sum of even intergers
    odSum: Sum of odd intergers
 
 Algorithm:
    - Get the number of integers 
    - Start with 0 and go up to entered number of integers
    - Determine whether the number is even or add
    - Print the sum
