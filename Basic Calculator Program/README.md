 Problem:
   Write a program that mimics a calculator.
   The program should take as input two integers and the
   operation to be performed. It should then output the
   numbers, the operator, and the result. (For division, if
   the denominator is zero, output an appropriate message.)

 Analysis: 
    Run an if statement and use the two values with the operation.
    For division, create two else if loop, one for 0 and one for non 0.
 
 Program:
   Input:
     num1: Value 1
     num2: Value 2
     op: +, -, *, or /
   Output:
     The result
 
 Algorithm:
    - Get two intergers and an operation
    - Set if loop
    - Set char op to the operation
    - Perform the calculation
    - Display the result
