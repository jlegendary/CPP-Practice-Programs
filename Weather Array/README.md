Problem:  
Write a program that uses a two-dimensional array to store the highest and lowest temperatures for each month of the year. The program should output the average high, average low, and the highest and lowest temperatures for the year. Store the data in a two-dimensional array.

Analysis:  
The data can be stored in a 12 X 2 array  where the low temperatures are stored in first column and the high temperatures are stored in the second column. Each row represents a month. For test data, I used temperature data from weather-wharehouse.com for Hampton, VA in January. From this page you can select a year and then get to the data for other months:
