Problem:  
	Write a program that reads in a line consisting of a name, Social Security number, user ID, and password. The program outputs the string in which all the digits of the Social Security number and all the characters in the password are replaced by x. (The Social Security number is in the form 000-00-0000, and the user ID and the password do not contain any spaces.) 
  
Analysis:  
	Read in a line consisting of a student's name, SSN, userID, and password, and output a string where all the digits and character of the SSN and password are replaced by 'x'.
  
  
Algorithm:  
 	-Get inputLine
 	-Extract name, SSN, userID, password from inputLine
 	-Hide the SSN digits (hideSSN)
 	-Hide the password characters (hidePassword)
 	-Display name, SSN, userID, password

   
Program inputs:  
	Name, SSN, userID, and password.

Program output:  
	Display the name, SSN, userID, and password with the SSN and password censored with 'x'.
