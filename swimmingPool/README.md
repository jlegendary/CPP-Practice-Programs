Problem:  
Write the definition of a class, swimmingPool, to implement the properties of a swimming pool. Your class should have the instance variables to store the length (in feet), width (in feet), depth (in feet), the rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is filling the pool, and the rate (in gallons per minute) at which the water is draining from the pool. Add appropriate constructors to initialize the instance variables. Also add member functions to do the following: determine the amount of water needed to fill an empty or partially filled pool, determine the time needed to completely or partially fill or empty the pool, and add or drain water for a specific amount of time.
